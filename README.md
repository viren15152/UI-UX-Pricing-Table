## Description

This is a web application that allows users to view and select a subscription plan with a dynamic pricing table. The pricing plans are displayed with different tiers (Basic, Pro, Premium) and users can toggle between monthly and yearly pricing. Each plan comes with different features and users can select a plan to proceed to the checkout page. This project was created as part of my effort to improve my **UI/UX design skills**. I focused on building an intuitive and user-friendly interface while ensuring a seamless and engaging experience. The design incorporates dynamic interactions, responsive elements, and clear feedback to help users make their selection easily.

Features include:

- **Toggle Pricing**: Switch between monthly and yearly pricing with a button.
- **Select Plan**: Users can choose between different subscription plans (Basic, Pro, Premium).
- **Interactive Pricing**: Pricing changes dynamically when switching between monthly and yearly views.
- **Responsive Design**: The table is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
